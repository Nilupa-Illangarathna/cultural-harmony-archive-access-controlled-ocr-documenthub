Introduced around 500 B.C. by migrants, Sinhala's evolution involved influences from Tamil and European languages. Prince Vijaya's group from North India forms the Sinhalese ancestry, integrating with indigenous populations over 2,500 years. Buddhism, embraced by 93% of Sinhala speakers in 1988, plays a pivotal role, with cultural and political ties emphasized in folklore. Buddhist monks are esteemed, and monastic life is a respected career. Despite commonalities, distinctions exist between \"Kandyan\" and \"low country\" Sinhalese. The Kingdom of Kandy retained traditional practices until 1818, while coastal areas underwent changes during European rule. Coastal inhabitants, influenced by Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionaries, saw conversions to Christianity. Social mobility and a new elite emerged, marked by knowledge of European languages and civil administration. The low-country Sinhalese developed a cosmopolitan perspective, setting them apart from their highland counterparts.", "The Sinhalese, the largest ethnic group in Sri Lanka, accounted for 74 percent of the population in 1981, with approximately 11 million people. They are primarily identified by their language, Sinhala, which belongs to the Indo-European language group and shares roots with Hindi and other North Indian languages, as well as many European languages. It is believed that migrants from North India brought an early form of Sinhala to the island around 500 B.C., introducing an agricultural economy that remained dominant for centuries. Over time, Sinhala has incorporated numerous loanwords and structures from Tamil and European languages, particularly English. The Sinhalese trace their heritage back to Prince Vijaya and his group of immigrants from northern India, although intermarriage with indigenous populations likely occurred. Over the past 2,500 years, the Sinhalese have assimilated various castes and tribal groups from both the island and southern India. Buddhism plays a significant role in uniting the Sinhalese community, with around 93 percent of Sinhala speakers being Buddhists in 1988, and virtually all Buddhists in Sri Lanka speaking Sinhala. Sinhalese folklore, literature, and rituals emphasize the special relationship between Buddhism and the island's culture and politics, reinforcing the importance of preserving this cultural heritage. Buddhist monks are highly respected and are involved in various important life events. Becoming a monk is a respected career choice for many young men, and Buddhist monasteries or shrines are central to the cultural life of Sinhalese villagers. While a shared language and religion unite all ethnic Sinhalese, there are distinctions between the \"Kandyan\" and the \"low country\" Sinhalese. The Kingdom of Kandy in the highlands retained traditional cultural and social practices until 1818, with English education having less influence and traditional Buddhist education playing a crucial role in preserving Sinhalese culture. In contrast, the plains and coastal areas underwent significant changes during 400 years of European rule. Many coastal inhabitants, particularly from the Karava caste, converted to Christianity due to the efforts of Portuguese, Dutch, and British missionaries. Social mobility based on economic opportunities or service to colonial governments led entire caste or kin groups to rise in the social hierarchy. The old distinctions between noble and servile statuses faded, and a new elite emerged based on knowledge of European languages and civil administration. The Dutch legal system also influenced family law. This resulted in a more cosmopolitan perspective among the low-country Sinhalese, setting them apart from their highland counterparts."),
            new LatestNews("Tamils", "images/news and events images/img2.jpg", "The Tamils, constituting around 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population in 1981, are a distinctive group with Tamil as their native language, a Dravidian language pre-dating Indo-European languages. Tamil has a rich literary tradition spanning over 2,000 years in southern India. Migration from southern India to Sri Lanka has occurred since prehistoric times, with the Sinhalese, who later controlled the island, viewing Tamil-speaking immigrants as foreign. The Sri Lankan Tamils, comprising 12.7 percent of the population in 1981, have deep historical roots and are considered a native minority, while Indian Tamils, immigrants who arrived under British sponsorship, constituted 5.5 percent of the population. Despite differences, ethnic Tamils share common religious beliefs, the Tamil language, and culture, with the majority being Hindus. However, religious practices, cultural traditions, and caste systems within the Tamil community can create divisions. The Indian Tamil population has decreased due to repatriation programs, and a minority of Tamils have converted to Christianity, further contributing to the division of the Tamil minority into two main groups, each with its own Christian minority.", "The Tamils, making up about 18 percent of the population in 1981, are a distinct group in Sri Lanka, with Tamil as their native language. Tamil is a Dravidian language found mainly in peninsular India, predating the arrival of Indo-European languages around 1500 B.C. Tamil has a rich literary tradition that spans over 2,000 years in southern India and has retained many purely Dravidian elements. Over 40 million people in Tamil Nadu, India, and Tamil emigrants worldwide speak Tamil. Migration from southern India to Sri Lanka has been ongoing since prehistoric times. However, the Sinhalese, who later controlled the island, considered their own language and culture native, viewing Tamil-speaking immigrants as a foreign ethnic group. Some immigrants adopted Sinhala and integrated into the Sinhalese caste system, while most retained Tamil and identified with their cultural homeland in southern India. Contacts with Tamil Nadu were reinforced during struggles between Sri Lankan kings and southern Indian powers, especially during the Chola wars, which likely brought many Tamil speakers to Sri Lanka. Tamil speakers in Sri Lanka fall into two distinct groups with different origins and relationships to the country. Sri Lankan Tamils have deep historical roots and are considered a native minority, comprising 12.7 percent of the population in 1981. On the other hand, Indian Tamils are immigrants or descendants of immigrants who arrived under British sponsorship to work on plantations in the central highlands. They numbered 5.5 percent of the population in 1981 and have remained somewhat separate from other groups, being viewed as foreigners by the Sinhalese. The Indian Tamil population has decreased due to repatriation programs to Tamil Nadu. Despite differences, ethnic Tamils share common religious beliefs, the Tamil language, and culture. About 80 percent of Sri Lankan Tamils and 90 percent of Indian Tamils are Hindus, with little connection to Buddhism, the dominant religion in Sri Lanka. Their religious practices and cultural traditions are distinct from those of the Sinhalese. Tamil caste systems also differ from those of the Sinhalese, rooted in religious ideologies not shared by the latter. However, religion and caste can create divisions within the Tamil community. Most Indian Tamils belong to lower Indian castes, which are not respected by the upper and middle castes of Sri Lankan Tamils. Additionally, a minority of Tamils have converted to Christianity, with their own places of worship and distinct cultural practices. This leads to a significant separation from mainstream Sinhalese culture and the division of the Tamil minority into two main groups, each with its own Christian minority."),
            new LatestNews("Muslims", "images/news and events images/img3.jpg", "The Muslim community in Sri Lanka comprises around 7 percent of the population and is characterized by diversity among its three main sections: the Sri Lankan Moors, the Indian Moors, and the Malays. The Sri Lankan Moors, constituting the majority, trace their roots to Arab traders, adopting the Tamil language and settling in coastal areas. Persecution during Portuguese colonization led many to relocate to the Central Highlands. They predominantly speak Tamil or \"Arabic Tamil\" and follow kinship practices from Kerala, governed by Islamic law. The Indian Moors originated from immigrants seeking economic opportunities during the colonial period, with groups like the Memon, Bohra, and Khoja maintaining distinct places of worship and ancestral languages. Malays, rooted in Southeast Asia, arrived during Dutch colonization, with their identity tied to the Malay language enriched by Sinhalese and Tamil influences. In the 1980s, Malays constituted about 5 percent of the Muslim population in Sri Lanka.", "The Muslim community in Sri Lanka, constituting approximately 7 percent of the population, is a diverse group of religious minorities who practice Islam. Like other ethnic groups, Muslims have their own distinct places of worship, religious and cultural figures, social circles, and even languages. The Muslim community in Sri Lanka is further categorized into three main sections: the Sri Lankan Moors, the Indian Moors, and the Malays, each with its unique historical background and cultural traditions. The Sri Lankan Moors represent the majority of the Muslim population, making up 93 percent, and approximately 7 percent of the total population in 1981 (1,046,926 people). They trace their ancestry to Arab traders who settled in southern India and Sri Lanka between the eighth and fifteenth centuries. Over time, they adopted the Tamil language, which was the lingua franca of Indian Ocean trade, and established permanent communities in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Moors predominantly lived in coastal trading and agricultural areas, preserving their Islamic cultural heritage while embracing many South Asian customs. During the period of Portuguese colonization, the Moors faced persecution, leading many to relocate to the Central Highlands, where their descendants still reside. The Sri Lankan Moors predominantly speak Tamil or a version known as \"Arabic Tamil,\" enriched with numerous Arabic words. In some regions, their lineage is traced through women, following kinship practices from the southwest Indian state of Kerala, but their governance adheres to Islamic law. The Indian Moors, on the other hand, are Muslims who can trace their origins to immigrants who sought economic opportunities during the colonial period. Some of these individuals arrived in the country during the Portuguese era, while others came during the British colonial period from various regions in India. Groups like the Memon, originally from Sind (in modern Pakistan), began arriving in 1870, with their numbers reaching about 3,000 in the 1980s. The Bohra and the Khoja, hailing from northwestern India's Gujarat State, arrived after 1880, collectively numbering fewer than 2,000 by the 1980s. These groups tended to maintain their own places of worship and the languages of their ancestral homelands.The Malays have their roots in Southeast Asia and their ancestors came to Sri Lanka during the time when both Sri Lanka and Indonesia were Dutch colonies. Many early Malay immigrants were soldiers sent by the Dutch colonial administration to Sri Lanka, who later chose to settle on the island. Others were convicts or members of noble houses from Indonesia who were exiled to Sri Lanka and never returned. The preservation of Malay identity is largely tied to their common Malay language, known as \"bahasa melayu,\" which incorporates numerous words influenced by Sinhalese and Tamil. In the 1980s, Malays constituted about 5 percent of the Muslim population in Sri Lanka."),

    introduction1: "Welcome to our website, where we explore the intricate dimensions of ethnicity, delving into three key terms: 'ethnicity,' 'ethnic identity,' and 'ethnic group.' 'Ethnic identity' encapsulates an individual's self-concept shaped by identification with a broader group, rooted in perceived cultural differences and common descent. An 'ethnic group' is characterized by individuals who distinguish themselves or are set apart by others based on cultural distinctions or shared ancestry. 'Ethnicity' encompasses the social and psychological aspects associated with a culturally constructed group identity.",
    introduction2: "In the realm of anthropology, an 'ethnic group' is typically understood as a population with biological continuity, shared cultural values, manifested unity in cultural expressions, a field of communication and interaction, and self-identification as a distinguishable category. However, identifying a homogeneous ethnic group can be challenging, particularly when relying on commonly shared traits of language and culture. This complexity is evident in the context of Sri Lanka. Join us as we navigate and illuminate the multifaceted landscape of ethnicity on our platform.",
